### Issues
 - Advanced options don't do anything
 - Can't navigate directly to other urls
 - Can only have one of each type of equipment
 - Site locks up when calculating instead of using some sort of spinner
 - Need to input artifact levels before equipment information, otherwise the bonuses will get modified by the equipment boosting artifacts

### UI things
 - Show update if new update
 - Drag and drop
 - Highlight input when invalid
 - Highlight the equipped pet/equip
 - Graphically show skill tree
 - Fix input typing
 - Allow invalid inputs
 - Displays differently on mac?
 - Steps get slightly larger with long artifact names
 - Spinner for logging in
 - Localization selector
 - Expand pet options to display effects
 - Pair pets by bonus type
 - Pet sorting - by bonus, by type
 - Don't necessarily need full hero name
 - "Saved!" animation
 - ? reset upon logout?
 - Sort artifacts by type

### Things to add
 - Figure out offline gold
 - Relics from stage
 - Equipment evaluator
 - Salvage costs
 - Skill tree explorer
 - Stats useful for clan consideration (basic MS, damage, or something)

### Things
 - Don't edit equip bonuses if artifacts input after
 - Option for aa/ab notation
 - Cookie management
 - Active skill weighting, option to not consider actives
 - Variable gold conversion factors
 - Fold tps parameter into gamestate object
 - Check application of equipment boosts in game code
 - Check for "formatBonus" in game code
 - Change notPercentageBonus - not not?
 - Re-check skills<->bonuses, not all are bound
 - Skill level weights for hero level optimizer
 - Passwords are sent as plaintext
 - Usernames are case sensitive
 - Resetting password
 - Redux-form
 - Automated ServerVarsModel.cs -> ServerVarsModel.js
 - Google analytics

### Code Organization
 - Break up actions.js
 - Break up reducers
 - Break up main.less
 - Get rid of superfluous components
 - Don't need any of the bower stuff
