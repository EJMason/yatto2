Immediate
 * Different buttons/steps for relics/gold/pet/hero/equip optimization
 * User accounts
 * More styling
 * async actions with redux-think

 * Active skill weighting
 * Variable gold conversion factors
 * Other optimization weights (AD, gold, tapping)
    * Figure out offline gold

 * Even more styling
 * Options for calculating
	* Include steps that go over relic limit (always optimal vs use all relics)
	* Optimize other things first before artifacts
	* Relics vs steps
	* Consider actives

Small things
 * Hover for plus and drag icons and stuff
 * Spinner for getting steps
 * Spinner for logging in

Stuff
 * check in code where equipment boosts are applied
 * check in code for a "formatBonus"
 * Editing equipment values is pretty fucked up
 * notPercentageBonuses - really need "not"?
 * Localization selector
 * Drag and drop artifacts
 * Drag and drop equipment

More Stuff
 * Order skills intelligently
 	* Graphically display skills in a tree
 * Expand pet options to display effects
 * Pair the pets by bonus type
 * Don't necessarily need full hero name

Other forms
 * Relics from stage
 * Equipment comparer
 * UA forms
 * Salvage costs

Other pages
 * Artifact costs/stats explorer
 * Formulas
 * FAQ/Thanks/Help
 * Re-check skills<->bonuses, not all are bound
 * Check relative hero skill bonuses compared to everything else (extra weight for skills in gold/hero level optimizer?)
 * Changelog

 Eventually
 * Redux-form
 * Automated ServerVarsModel.cs -> ServerVarsModel.js
 * Document where formulas come from
 * Google analytics
