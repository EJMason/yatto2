Immediate
 * Rework calculator.getRelicSteps and StepButton.getSteps to work together (return actual steps)
 * Stats fields upon file load / gamestate change
 * Options for calculating

Intermediate
 * Active skill weighting
 * User accounts
 * Drag and drop
 * Skill tree
 * Different buttons/steps for relic, gold, pet/equip optimization

Eventually
 * Redux-form

Things to add
 * Relic from stage
 * Salvage cost

Random stuff
 * Re-check skills<->bonuses
 * How to graphically skill tree
 * Optimal hero/swordmaster - greedy cost to next breakpoint
 * Damage Equivalence - with ^, then get proportion and current factors?
 * Check hero skill bonuses compared with everything else (weight for gold optimizer)
 * UA
 * option to include steps that go over relic count (always optimal vs use all relics)
 * document where formulas come from
 * Everything else
